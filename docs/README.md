Lump aims to make working with data objects in PHP quick and effortless.
For many developers working with data objects, and simple REST APIs in PHP is a daily 
process.  Although JSON is simple to parse and read, keeping track of the structure, and 
sifting through stdClasses and arrays can be tedious. Lump simplifies this by adding simple 
search features, simplifying data manipulation and serialization, and allows you to define 
the expected structure with very minimal code.
